Royal Smart Computer

Royal Smart Computer is a modern web application built to simplify computer sales management and market analysis.
It allows admins to post computers based on their specifications, handle warranty generation with digital signatures, and analyze market performance with real-time data.

The goal of this project is to make computer selling and tracking smarter, faster, and more efficient.

Features
1. Login Authentication

The app includes a secure login system for both admins and buyers.
Passwords are encrypted for safety, and different roles are supported (for example, admins can manage listings while buyers can browse and purchase).

2. Post Computers by Specification

Admins can easily post computers with all their details â€” such as CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, and price.
Buyers can filter and search based on these specifications to find exactly what they need.

3. Warranty and Signature Generation

When a buyer makes a purchase, the system automatically generates a digital signature and a warranty certificate.
The warranty is only valid for a specific time period, and users can verify or download it later if needed.

4. Market Analysis

The dashboard includes analytics that show weekly and monthly sales data, the number of sold units, and which products are performing best.
This helps admins understand the market and make smarter decisions based on real numbers.
